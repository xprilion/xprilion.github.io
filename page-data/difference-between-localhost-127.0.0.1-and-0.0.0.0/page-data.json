I shall attempt to answer the question in this post.</p>\n<h2>What is 127.0.0.1</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">127.0.0.1</code> is the loopback address. It means, whatever request is made, send it back to the same machine. When a remote host calls this, they’re actually calling themselves. </p>\n<h2>What is localhost</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">localhost</code> is simply a conventional mapping done in the <code class=\"language-text\">hosts</code> file of the OS. It can be changed. I could ask <code class=\"language-text\">google.com</code> to point to my loopback address and that would work same.</p>\n<h2>What is 0.0.0.0</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">0.0.0.0</code> is a wildcard for all open routes to the system within the system where the script runs. </p>\n<h2>When do you face the need to differentiate between them -</h2>\n<p>We specifically face the problem of differentiating them in Flask/Django/NodeJS applications because these are runtimes which require the user to define which IP (or routes) to listen on. If you’ve ever tried web development on PHP, you’d realize that the <code class=\"language-text\">localhost</code> web server was accessible using the IP of the computer’s LAN as well from other devices (say your mobile). This is because by default Apache listens on <code class=\"language-text\">*:80</code> which essentially means <code class=\"language-text\">0.0.0.0:80</code>, as given in its default virtual host configuration file - </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># Ensure that Apache listens on port 80\nListen 80\n&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;  # Notice this\n    DocumentRoot &quot;/var/www/html&quot; # OR &quot;C:/xampp/htdocs&quot; for Windows systems with XAMPP installation\n\n    # Other directives here\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Difference between localhost, 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0","date":"January 04, 2020","comments":true,"nid":"100007"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/difference-between-localhost-127.0.0.1-and-0.0.0.0/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"OMG, a new look!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/venkat-panchapakesan-memorial-scholarship-part-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is the Venkat Panchapakesan Memorial Scholarship and Why its not won in a day."}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1296475691","3128451518"]}
