18:T184a,<p>This blog has been written for the Hashnode Headless API Hackathon and the Gatsby + Hashnode Headless + Typescript is publicly available at - <a href="https://github.com/xprilion/gatsby-hashnode-headless">https://github.com/xprilion/gatsby-hashnode-headless</a></p><p>Since 2019, when I switched to a minimal content layout for my website, I dreamt of creating a lot of content on the site. However, that was not the story that unfolded after the revamp. What went wrong?</p><p>I am someone who focuses a lot on the value of the knowledge that is being offered through the content I create. What that means is - I love writing detailed blogs discussing mix of technologies. However, at the same time I love sharing my own feelings on various social topics through the blog and here lies the challenge - a blog that renders markdown files gets very tedious to maintain very quickly when you are working on different types of blogs at the same time.</p><p>I was creating a lot of markdown files on my local and would forget all about them later. I was not able to keep track of the content I was creating and could not edit this content from any device other than my laptop.</p><p>In 2023, I was came across Hashnode. I loved the simplicity of writing blogs on the platform and was amazed by the on-spot optimizations done by the team on each blog page. It was the perfect writing companion for me. Unfortunately, I had invested a good amount in my own website over the years and had a strict adherence to the absolutely minimal layout. This was tough to achieve with Hashnode, and hence, it was still not the solution to my problem.</p><h2 id="introducing-hashnode-headless">Introducing Hashnode Headless</h2><p>In later 2023, I was introduced to an upcoming Headless mode of Hashnode. This was super exciting for me and I decided to wait. The day Hashnode headless launched, I headed over to the feature page at <a href="https://hashnode.com/headless">https://hashnode.com/headless</a> and then explored the APIs at <a href="https://gql.hashnode.com/">https://gql.hashnode.com/</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img loading="lazy" src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/4ml9m8u/2025/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2864" height="1624"></figure><p>After a brief scouring I had realized - I had hit jackpot!</p><p>Using Hashnode headless, I could keep the extreme customization I had built along with the powerful blog creation process available on Hashnode.</p><p>A simple query could fetch my blogs safely from my Hashnode account in either HTML or Markdown format, as I needed it!</p><pre><code class="language-bash">query Publication {
  publication(host: "xprilion.hashnode.dev") {
    isTeam
    title
    posts(first: 20) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          brief
          url
          tags {
            slug
          }
          coverImage {
            url
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>There was however the challenge of fetching all my blogs from the GQL API, which was limited to 20 blogs in a go. This was easily solved by using a paginated query, with powerful support for pagination from Hashnode's GQL server.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
</code></pre><p>And finally, I needed to display different types of content on the blog. For this, I used tags on the blog settings to figure out what sort of layout I need to render for that blog entry. Using this, I was able to render the same markdown content as a Blog, a Codelab and a Presentation at the same time!</p><p>Here's the link to the full query - <a href="https://github.com/xprilion/gatsby-hashnode-headless/blob/main/gatsby-node.ts">https://github.com/xprilion/gatsby-hashnode-headless/blob/main/gatsby-node.ts</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img loading="lazy" src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/4ml9m8u/2025/05/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2864" height="1624"></figure><p>Hashnode headless was solving every issue I had. However, there was a tiny problem yet to be solved.</p><p>I had to manually redeploy the repo whenever I created or edited any blog on Hashnode. This was definitely not going to fly for the amount of freedom I wanted.</p><h2 id="deploy-to-github-pages-from-hashnode">Deploy to Github Pages from Hashnode</h2><p>This was unfortunately a paid feature. But...I am a developer, right? :D Yes I needed to auto-deploy from my Hashnode blog to my website. There was a simple solution.</p><p>Hashnode has an amazing feature of Webhooks. Using Webhooks, I could trigger actions on an external endpoint. However, this was as of yet not my solution. The webhooks here were in a format which doesn't work directly with Github.</p><p>What could be done?</p><p>Here's the architecture of the solution I built for this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img loading="lazy" src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/4ml9m8u/2025/05/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="720"></figure><p>The Google Cloud Function code I wrote for this is available at - <a href="https://github.com/xprilion/google-cloud-functions-trigger-github-action/tree/hashnode-trigger">https://github.com/xprilion/google-cloud-functions-trigger-github-action/tree/hashnode-trigger</a></p><p>The Github Actions workflow file I used for this is available at - <a href="https://github.com/xprilion/gatsby-hashnode-headless/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml">https://github.com/xprilion/gatsby-hashnode-headless/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml</a></p><h2 id="success">Success</h2><p>With all the setup put together - I now have an extremely customized website hosted at <a href="https://xprilion.com">https://xprilion.com</a> (Also where you are reading this!) which deploys automatically from Hashnode (this blog was auto-deployed!)</p><p>I am using Listmonk for newsletter, Cusdis for comments.</p><p>And this blog is a entry for the Hashnode Headless API Hackathon! <a href="https://hashnode.com/n/apihackathon">#APIHackathon</a></p>6:["$","$L14",null,{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":[["$","$L15",null,{"href":"/posts","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline mb-4 block","children":"← Back to all posts"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-2","children":"Revamping my blog with Hashnode Headless CMS"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200 text-sm ","children":"2 February, 2024"}]]}],["$","$L16",null,{"src":"https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/4ml9m8u/2025/05/aa9ff004-d8de-4f55-9201-7289d30fb6e6.jpeg","alt":"Revamping my blog with Hashnode Headless CMS","loading":"lazy","className":"w-full h-auto mb-6 rounded-lg object-cover object-center shadow-md shadow-gray-400/30 dark:shadow-gray-700/30","width":1000,"height":1000}],["$","$L17",null,{"html":"$18","slug":"gatsby-hashnode-headless-starter-kit","title":"Revamping my blog with Hashnode Headless CMS"}],["$","$L19",null,{"id":"MathJax-script","src":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js","async":true,"strategy":"afterInteractive"}],["$","$L19",null,{"id":"MathJax-config","strategy":"beforeInteractive","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"\n          MathJax = {\n            tex: {\n              inlineMath: [['((', '))']],\n              displayMath: [['[[', ']]']],\n            },\n            svg: {\n              fontCache: 'global'\n            }\n          };\n        "}}]]}]
