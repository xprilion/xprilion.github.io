That left more power for the ML models to run! For this, I had to trim down the list of applications I needed to run parallely on the laptop.</p><p>It can get confusing and tough to choose the 'right set of applications' you need.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-decide-what-applications-i-need">How do I decide what applications I need?</h2><p>If you do not have a definite plan and list of requirements that you have from your system, it can be tough to choose the applications you need to run parallely.</p><p>In my case, I needed to run machine learning models, but I also had a daily limit on the Internet bandwidth available to me. I had two choices -</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/4ml9m8u/2025/04/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="500" height="756"></figure><p>I could choose to run my ML models locally and save on the daily limit on my Internet. But then I would have to spend on buying an extension for the RAM. Or I could run the models online and find a way to minimize my Internet consumption.</p><p>This is a story of how I chose the latter option, and never looked back.</p><blockquote>Also, it is a short reminder that decisions made by developers often revolve around financial constraints and that's <strong>okay</strong>.</blockquote><p>Once you have laid down all your needs and constraints very clearly before yourself, you'll find it simple to sort things out. Try putting them on a paper! :)</p><h2 id="what-applications-did-i-choose">What applications did I choose?</h2><p>After more decisions like the example above, my list of requirements boiled down to the following -</p><h3 id="1-a-minimal-linux-desktop">1. A minimal Linux desktop</h3><p>For this I chose <a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/Main_Page">LXDE</a> which in its default installation contained the <a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/Openbox">Openbox</a> desktop environment. It is super minimal, only offering me with a black screen and a menu to get things done in the most frills-away manner.</p><p>With this choice, I immediately dropped the RAM usage by the default applications on my system to something around 200-300 MBs. I still had almost 6x the amount of that RAM to play with!</p><h3 id="2-a-code-editor-that-didnt-do-what-i-did-not-ask-it-to">2. A code editor that didn't do what I did not ask it to</h3><p>While you may love your favorite code editor, it is worthwhile to check the amount of resources it is eating on your system. With <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a>, I felt power, but that power felt sluggish.</p><p>As a replacement to Spyder, I chose to use <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colaboratory</a> (we'll talk about this again) in the browser and for non-ML related tasks, I chose <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a>.</p><p>Sublime Text gave me a barebones editor with a few cool things, which didn't eat away at the RAM. Hence, leaving me enough free RAM to run a browser!</p><h3 id="3-a-browser-that-was-modern-and-fast">3. A browser that was modern and fast</h3><p>Now this is where you may doubt my choice - I chose <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> as my only browser on the system.</p><p>Yes, it did consume a lot of RAM. But at the same time, it offered me superb support for Colaboratory which I was going to use for running my ML models. The decision was simple.</p><p>A habit of minimal Chrome tab usage was developed. I still obsessively close tabs which I do not need.</p><h2 id="is-that-all">Is that all?</h2><p>Yeah, that's pretty much all the setup you'll need to start using your old dusty laptop for machine learning experiments!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/4ml9m8u/2025/04/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500"></figure><p>Actually, we can have the questions in the comments below.</p><h2 id="what-did-you-learn-today">What did you learn today</h2><p>Today, in under 3 minutes you went through my then painful story of how I started my machine learning exploration on a 2GB RAM machine back in 2016.
