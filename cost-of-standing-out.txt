Many of them on the search engine would search our names accompanied by slangs and abuses.</p><p>I failed to understand why it happened, and I took the pain of seeing this silently, without sharing it with anyone. Yes, we were all too young then to understand cyber-bullying. But were we too young to not feel the pain it caused? And how do you explain what he did wrong to a kid who put in all his heart and soul in creating a platform, which not many at his age could do, which was used to abuse him?</p><p>9 years later, I realize that what those schoolmates did was not because of their hatred towards me, but because they could not digest the fact that someone from among them was trying to stand out of the norm. God bless the rare few of them who found success in their passions, most of those schoolmates today are toiling the 9-5 at companies that will replace them at the first opportunity.</p><p>I do not name anyone here, my intention is not to hold anyone accountable.
